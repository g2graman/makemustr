# makemustr

This repository's sole purpose is to publicly expose the [Makefile](https://github.com/g2graman/makemustr/blob/master/Makefile) for `Mustr` (to which access must be granted since it is a private repository at the time of writing this readme).  The reason for the [Makefile](https://github.com/g2graman/makemustr/blob/master/Makefile)'s exposure is that it facilitates build automation dependent (or not) of the VM it is meant to be built on. Public exposure is preferred to avoid having to authenticate for invoking `curl` to retrieve the raw [Makefile](https://github.com/g2graman/makemustr/blob/master/Makefile) [from this repository (from which you are currently reading this `README`)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g2graman/makemustr/master/Makefile), devoid of HTML structure so it can be used _out of the box_, _as is_, for immediately building the project with `make`.
